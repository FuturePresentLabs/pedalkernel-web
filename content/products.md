## Hardware (Coming Soon)

We're working on physical pedals. Same circuits, same math, actual metal boxes with knobs you can touch.

### Overdrive (Physical)
**Estimated: $189**

The Tube Screamer-style circuit from our plugin, hand-wired with carefully selected components. Through-hole construction, true bypass, premium op-amps.

- Status: In development
- Expected: Late 2025
- Sign up for updates

---

### Fuzz (Physical)
**Estimated: $169**

Germanium fuzz with the instability and character that makes vintage units collectible. NOS transistors, hand-matched for the right leakage and gain.

- Status: Prototyping
- Expected: Late 2025
- Sign up for updates

---

### Delay (Physical)
**Estimated: $249**

Analog bucket-brigade delay with modulation. The darkening repeats, the clock noise, the way it falls apart in just the right way.

- Status: Circuit design phase
- Expected: 2026
- Sign up for updates

## Boutique One-Offs

### Custom Pedal Build
**$2,500**

For the true tone-freaks. A custom-designed pedal built specifically for your rig, your playing style, your definition of "right."

We start with a conversation about what you're after — specific vintage units you've loved, problems with your current setup, sounds in your head you haven't been able to capture. Then we design a circuit, source components (including NOS parts if that's what it takes), and build you something that doesn't exist anywhere else.

- Initial consultation and circuit design
- Component sourcing (including NOS/rare parts if needed)
- Hand-wired construction
- Custom enclosure graphics
- Lifetime support and tweaks
- Only 2-3 builds per year

**Availability:** Limited — email to discuss
