## Software

We build circuit modeling tools for musicians who care about what's happening under the hood.

## Physical Pedals

We don't build hardware — we write code. But our circuits are being turned into physical pedals by our partners at **[Puget Audio](https://puget.audio/)**.

Same WDF models, same component values, but hand-wired with real solder and housed in metal boxes. If you want a PedalKernel circuit you can stomp on, [check them out](https://puget.audio/).

They offer:
- Standard production pedals based on our circuits
- Custom one-off builds for the true tone-freaks
- Laser-engraved enclosures
- NOS components when available
