## What is it?

PedalKernel Pro is a VST3 plugin for guitar and bass effects. We model analog circuits using Wave Digital Filter techniques — the same math that powers professional audio hardware.

Built for musicians who care about tone.

## Features

- **Overdrive, Fuzz, and Delay** — three classic effects, meticulously modeled
- **Zero-latency processing** — play without delay, even at low buffer sizes
- **Analog circuit modeling** — WDF algorithms capture the non-linear behavior of real pedals
- **3 activations** — use it on your studio machine, laptop, and backup rig
- **Lifetime updates** — buy once, get every future version

## Made in Seattle

We're based in Seattle, Washington — home of Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and countless other tone-obsessed musicians.

> "The only thing that matters is the tone. Everything else is just details."

This city has a long history of caring deeply about sound. We're just carrying that tradition forward into software.
