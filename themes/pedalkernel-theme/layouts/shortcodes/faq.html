          <span>What is Wave Digital Filter (WDF) technology?</span>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Wave Digital Filters are a mathematical framework for modeling analog circuits digitally. Unlike traditional DSP approximations, WDF models the actual physical behavior of circuit components (resistors, capacitors, op-amps) by simulating how waves propagate through them. This results in more accurate, stable, and musically pleasing emulations of analog gear.</p>

          <span>Does it work for bass guitar too?</span>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Absolutely! While we market toward guitarists, all PedalKernel models work great with bass. The overdrive adds harmonic content that helps bass cut through a mix, and the fuzz can create massive synth-like bass tones. The delay works beautifully on both instruments.</p>

          <p>PedalKernel is highly optimized. On modern CPUs (Intel i5/i7 or Apple Silicon), each pedal typically uses less than 3% CPU at 48kHz sample rate. The Rust-based audio engine uses zero-allocation paths during processing to ensure rock-solid real-time performance, even at low buffer sizes.</p>
